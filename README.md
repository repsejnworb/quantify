# quantify
Quantify is a stat tracker aiming to provide meaningful and interesting stats beyond what is available in Blizzard's Statistic Frame. The goal is for quantify to be a tool that can be used to identify trends, personal strengths/weaknesses, and play-styles. Moving forward, the focus will be on creating stats that can answer questions like: Am I leveling efficiently? What dungeons and bosses am I struggling on? How many equipment upgrades am I getting per raid night? Am I farming mats efficiently? How much time am I spending fetching my corpse, AFK, or chilling in the faction hub?
